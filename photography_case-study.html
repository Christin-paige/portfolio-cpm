        DKL Photography is a web application that showcases a photographer's work in
        categorized galleries. The portfolio uses React as the front-end
        framework and Sanity.io as the content management system (CMS),
        allowing the client to manage his photos and to build an online presence.

      <p> My client shared his photos through social media, however there was no
        organization system. He wanted a platform to easily share his photos, add
        or remove photos, and dynamically update content through Sanity.io without
        redeploying the app. Each photo is organized into a category, Wildlife,
        Astro, and Out and About. Visitors can navigate through the different
        galleries and view high-quality images.</p>
