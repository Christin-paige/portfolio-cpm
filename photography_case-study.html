  <p class="lead">
    A web application that showcases a photographer's work in
    categorized galleries. The portfolio uses React as the front-end
    framework and Sanity.io as the content management system (CMS),
    allowing the client to manage his photos and to build an online presence.

    <div class="problem">
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      My client shared his photos through social media, however there was no
      organization system. He wanted a platform to easily share his photos, add
      or remove photos, and dynamically update content through Sanity.io without
      redeploying the app. Each photo is organized into a category, Wildlife,
      Astro, and Out and About. Visitors can navigate through the different
      galleries and view high-quality images.

    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic Content: Manage photos and their categories in Sanity.io</li>
      <li>Image Categorization: Photos and displayed based on categories.</li>

    <h4>Backend / Content Management System (CMS)</h4>
    <p>After weeks of researching and reaching out to freelance developers, I finally came across Sanity.io, a CMS that was perfect for what I wanted to accomplish with this site.  Sanity.io is compatible with React and the user interface is simple enough that my client with little developer expertise can easily add content, delete content, and update content with ease.</p>
    <p>I chose Netlify to deploy the app.  This service is a great option being connected to Github, whenever there is an update to the site, it automatically deploys.  This makes it great for my client to update and have his site current with the updates independently.</p>
